#  GeodesicGaze

GeodesicGaze takes live video feeds from the front and rear facing cameras of the iPhone and simulates the effects of lensing by a rotating (Kerr) black hole. The result is displayed in real-time to the user's screen.

The user interface is implemented using Swift and the SwiftUI framework. The lensing calculations are done on the GPU via Metal, Apple's shading (graphics) language.
